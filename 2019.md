## Generate the installation script from the Azure portal

The script to automate the download and installation, and to establish the connection with Azure Arc, is available from the Azure portal. To complete the process, perform the following steps:

1. From your browser, go to the Azure portal.

2. On the Servers - Azure Arc page, select Add at the upper left.

3. On the Select a method page, select the Add a single server tile, and then select Generate script.

4. On the Generate script page, select the subscription and resource group where you want the machine to be managed within Azure. Select an Azure location where the machine metadata will be stored. This location can be the same or different, as the resource group's location.

5. On the Prerequisites page, review the information and then select Next: Resource details.

6. On the Resource details page, provide the following:
* In the Resource group drop-down list, select the resource group the machine will be managed from.
* In the Region drop-down list, select the Azure region to store the servers metadata.
* In the Operating system drop-down list, select the operating system that the script is configured to run on.
* If the machine is communicating through a proxy server to connect to the internet, specify the proxy server IP address or the name and port number that the machine will use to communicate with the proxy server. Enter the value in the format http://<proxyURL>:<proxyport>.
* Select Next: Tags.

7. On the Tags page, review the default Physical location tags suggested and enter a value, or specify one or more Custom tags to support your standards.

8. Select Next: Download and run script.
